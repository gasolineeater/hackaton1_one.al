## Implementation Details

The colors have been implemented in:

1. **Material UI Theme**: The theme in `App.jsx` has been configured with ONE Albania's colors
2. **CSS Variables**: Color variables in `colors.css` for consistent usage
3. **Component Styling**: All components have been updated to use the ONE Albania color scheme

## Design Principles

Based on ONE Albania's website (one.al), the following design principles have been applied:

1. **Clean and Minimal**: Simple, clean interfaces with ample white space
2. **Subtle Shadows**: Light shadows for depth without being too heavy
3. **Rounded Corners**: Slightly rounded corners (4px) for UI elements
4. **Bold Typography**: Strong typography with clear hierarchy
5. **Strategic Use of Color**: Purple is used sparingly for emphasis

## Examples

### Buttons
- Primary buttons: Purple background (#6A1B9A) with white text
- Secondary buttons: Lavender background (#9575CD) with white text
- Outlined buttons: White background with colored borders

### Cards
- White background (#FFFFFF)
- Light shadow
- Slightly rounded corners (8px)

### Navigation
- Active items: Purple indicator or text
- Hover state: Subtle background change

This color scheme creates a consistent, branded experience that aligns with ONE Albania's official website.
